# Titanic-Disaster-Logistic-Regression

This is my submission of the kaggle titanic disaster project.I have used a simple model of Logistic Regression based on available Tutorials.
Further changes on the basis of parameters such as Age,Sex,Pclass can easily be made which I have not delved into.

I have not calculated the train set accuraccy score in the py file but feel free to do so if you want to.

Note: I only used streamlit to display data but I haven't used it in the final file, so it is not required to install that library.

Final public test score: 0.7799
